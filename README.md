# A PLAN FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF ENGLISH SPELLING

I wanted to build a quick application using strategy pattern, in which a text is converted to the "year" of how to "improve" english based on this text attributed to Mark Twain (but it's probably not from him). M. J. Yilz is also attributed. Please see [this link](https://guidetogrammar.org/grammar/twain.htm).

## A PLAN FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF ENGLISH SPELLING by Mark Twain

```
For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer be part of the alphabet

The only kase in which "c" would be retained would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later

Year 2 might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with "i" and iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all

Jenerally, then, the improvement would kontinue iear bai iear with iear 5 doing awai with useless double konsonants, and iears 6-12 or so modifaiing vowlz and the rimeining voist and unvoist konsonants

Bai iear 15 or sou, it wud fainali bi posibl tu meik ius ov thi ridandant letez "c", "y" and "x" -- bai now jast a memori in the maindz ov ould doderez -- tu riplais "ch", "sh", and "th" rispektivli

Fainali, xen, aafte sam 20 iers ov orxogrefkl riform, wi wud hev a lojikl, kohirnt speling in ius xrewawt xe Ingliy-spiking werld
